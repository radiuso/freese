# react suspens

The goal is to experiment the React.lazy function with the Suspens component.
Components will be laoded on demand.
I create a component "Timeout" in order to postpone the lazy loading and the http query.

## Start

- `yarn start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
- `yarn run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
- `yarn storybook` - Run storybook
